# When-the-engineers-doctors-together

Journey of this project started in 2018, now @2020 contributed to the some extent.
Basically being an Software engineer wanted to contribute for society. 
Idea was clear to develop an android application through which patients can stay tuned with doctors even when they are not hospitalised.
With final year project have tried to implement a system particularly for smaller community who are differently abled (physically challenged).

The Project is SMART WHEELCHAIR: AUTONOMOUS MOVEMENT AND HEALTHCARE MONITORING.

The system focuses on providing the primary need to the handicap patients. 
The highlighting feature of this system is to get instant help to the disabled, along with the healthcare monitoring of the patient. 
These features will be implemented with the help of an Android Application.
Heartbeat, temperature and oxygen level's average data is continously updated on doctors database.
If the patient is suffering from any disease the required respective timings of medicine is updated to app & timely notified to patient.  
Additinally Piezo sensor will be used to detect the accidents of the wheelchair and instantly notify to nearest respective available doctor.
A help button and buzzer feature will also be provided on the wheelchair to keep the patient in touch with the nearest person or relative for any kind of emergency. 
A Static GPS will be used for tracking the live location of the wheelchair, and the most recent location will be displayed on the application. 
The ulterior motive of this system is to provide instant help to the disabled and reduce the accident ratio, along with monitoring the regular patient health.
